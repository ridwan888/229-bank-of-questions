        <p>This bank of questions contains a collection of questions and answers organized by subject. All the questions appeared in previous terms quizzes, midterms, and final exams. We put a lot of effort this term to provide you with separate files: one
            file contain only the question. The other file contains the question along with a typeset answer. The way for you to use this material most productively for your learning is for you.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>read the question carefully and understand it</li>
            <li>review any material that you need to review to solve the question</li>
            <li>write your own solution to the question on your own (or with a friend, this is not for grading)</li>
            <li>then grade yourself using the provided answer making notes on what assumptions you made that might have been wrong</li>
        </ul>

        <p> However, you may be pressed for time and you may not be able to work out a complete solution for all the questions in the bank. In such a situation you still should first read the file containing only the question. You should make sure that you:
        </p>

        <li> understand the question</li>
        <li>spend some "time alone" with the question. Think about how you would solve it. What knowledge technique you would need to use?</li>
        <li>make quick notes about your strategy even if you do not work out a complete solution</li>
        <li>only then you should read the provided solution. </li>

        <p>If you disagree with a solution, make sure that you let the teaching staff know. The provided solution might be wrong, or there might have been some change in the presentation of the material since the question was first formulated and solved.</p>
